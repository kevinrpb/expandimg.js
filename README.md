# expandimg.js

A rather na√Øve library to present images in your webpage. It allows to 'zoom in' an image. See it working in the [demo](./demo.html)

## How to use it

First, include the script file in your page. This will add a listener to all `<img />` elements. Then click any image to try it ^^
