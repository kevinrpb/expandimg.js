# expandimg.js

A rather na√Øve library to present images in your webpage. It allows to 'zoom in' an image. See it working in the [demo page](https://expandimg.kevinrpb.me), which is exactly this page with a fancy theme. Go to the bottom to click some images.

## How to use it

Plug and play, include the script file in your page. This will add a listener to all `<img />` elements. Then click any image to try it ^^

## Caveats

As of now, it assumes your images are **centered on screen**.

## How it looks

Go to the [demo page](https://expandimg.kevinrpb.me) and click any of this images =D
